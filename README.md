# Boomerang Flow Worker

The purpose of this image is to provide a base foundation for Boomerang Flow with the ability to execute the workflow steps

## How to Build

`docker build -t tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/ise/bmrg-worker-flow:0.0.1 .`

`docker push tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/ise/bmrg-worker-flow:0.0.1`

## Update Version of CLI

In the cli.js there is a version string for printing out. If you update the tag of the worker, please update this version string.

_TODO:_ update how this works.

## How to Test locally with Docker

1. Build with the Dockerfile-test by passing in `-f test.Dockerfile` to the docker build command
2. Run and pass in required commander parameters `docker run -i -t tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/ise/bmrg-worker-flow:0.0.1 -- sendSlackMessage @twlawrie Test Test`

_Note 1:_ This requires developers to have kept this dockerfile up to date
_Note 2:_ The test Dockerfile will try to immitate the peices that Kubernetes Controller takes care of such as mounting a `/data` directory and `/props/*.properties`

## How to Test locally with Node.js

1. Run cli.js and pass in arguments

```
node cli.js slack sendWebhook
```
