# Boomerang Flow Worker

The purpose of this image is to provide a base foundation for Boomerang Flow with the ability to execute the workflow steps

## Design

The CLI has a main cli.js which imports all the `*.js` files under `./commands` folder. These are then mapped to the task / plugins command that are sent through as arguments on the flow_task_template mongodb collection. A command and sub command are required for all runs.

### utils.js

Collection of utility functions to help plugin authors retrieve, resolve, and set properties.

### log.js

Collection of logging utilities using chalk to output nice values in the log for the user

### Failure

When a method fails, we need to set or return (depending on the type of method) by catching the error to log and then return process.exit(1). This allows the container to fail the Kubernetes Pod which will in turn eventually bubble up the failure to the UI.

## How to Build

`docker build -t tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/ise/bmrg-worker-flow:0.0.1 .`

`docker push tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/ise/bmrg-worker-flow:0.0.1`

## Update Version of CLI

In the cli.js there is a version string for printing out. If you update the tag of the worker, please update this version string.

_TODO:_ update how this works.

## Testing

### How to Test locally with Docker

1. Build with the Dockerfile-test by passing in `-f test.Dockerfile` to the docker build command
2. Run and pass in required commander parameters `docker run -i -t tools.boomerangplatform.net:8500/ise/bmrg-worker-flow:0.0.1 -- sendSlackMessage @twlawrie Test Test`

_Note 1:_ This requires developers to have kept this dockerfile up to date
_Note 2:_ The test Dockerfile will try to immitate the peices that Kubernetes Controller takes care of such as mounting a `/data` directory and `/props/*.properties`

### How to Test locally with Node.js

1. Ensure that you have the package cross-env installed
2. Run the node:cli script and pass in arguments
```
run node:cli slack sendWebhook
```

## Clean up

### Cleaning up jobs in Kubernetes

When running against the non production cluster. You will need to clean up your runs using `kubectl delete job -l "app=bmrg-flow"`
